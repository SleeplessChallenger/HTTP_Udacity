<h2>HTTP course</h2>

- During this course I built sites from simple `http.server` to Flask-powered ones
- also, used `cookies` to practice usage of them in `http headers`


1. In the `synopsis` you can find my notes made during the course
2. `bookmark` is a folder where I've built site supported by `Heroku`
3. `message_board` folder & other files are just code written during the course
    to hone various concepts
